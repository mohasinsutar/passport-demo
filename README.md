# Project Title & Description

Node application using [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/) Authentication middleware.
It uses Passport Local Strategy to authenticate user against the username and password stored in mongodb.
This project includes the registration page, login page and logout functionality.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js 6.11+](http://nodejs.org)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads)

## Quick Start and Installation

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
#Clone the Repository
$ git clone https://github.com/mohasinsutar/passport-demo passport-demo
#Change Directory
$ cd myapp
#install dependancy using npm or yarn
$ npm install or $ yarn install
#then simply start your application
$ npm start or $ yarn run start
```

*Note:** You can install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) through the npm package manager. If you already have Node.js installed then you should already have npm.
Once you have npm installed you can run:
```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

**Note:** I highly recommend installing [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).
It watches for any changes in your  node.js app and automatically restarts the
server.
